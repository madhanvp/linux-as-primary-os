# Linux as Primary OS

This repository documents my journey and reasoning behind moving from
Windows 11 to Linux (Arch Linux + Ubuntu).

This decision is not only for DevOps, but also for:
- Cost efficiency
- System control
- Performance
- Privacy
- Long-term learning

The repository will be updated as I continue experimenting and migrating.
