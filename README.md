# Linux as Primary OS – Decision & Migration Plan

This repository documents my journey of moving from Windows 11 to Linux
(Arch Linux + Ubuntu) as primary operating systems.

This decision is driven by:
- Cost efficiency (paid software limitations)
- System control and transparency
- DevOps workflow optimization
- Long-term learning and customization

## Planned OS Strategy

- Ubuntu → Primary OS for daily work & DevOps
- Arch Linux → Customization, learning, and UI-focused usage
- GitHub → Single source of truth for all projects

## Why This Matters

This repository reflects real-world DevOps thinking:
planning, documentation, version control, and reproducibility.

The repository will evolve as the system setup evolves.
