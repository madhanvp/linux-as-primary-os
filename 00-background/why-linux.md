## Why I Started Considering Linux

I purchased my laptop with Windows 11 Home and 1 year of Microsoft Office.
After 1.5 years, the Office subscription expired, making paid software
a recurring issue.

Windows also consumes more system resources and limits low-level control.
This pushed me to explore Linux as a long-term solution.
